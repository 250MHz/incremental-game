Ideas:
- Add a widget to the right hand side of all the ice cream buttons in the ice cream tab.
This widget controls the amount of ice cream that's converted. E.g. 1/5/10/25/100

- Add more Ice Cream flavors, make more Buildings and Resources and Ingredients in order to
make these new flavors.

- Add EXP. Finishing certain achievements (e.g. get 1 cow, get 10 cows, get 100 cows) will 
give EXP which will be shown by a Progressbar which will be in a separate Frame. 
Reaching certain levels can unlock new bonuses or powerups that the player can buy. Have the
powerups be in anoter tab in the Notebook.

- EXP unlocks this powerup: every 1 minutes, 10% chance to 3x all production +/sec for
30 secs. Use Resources to upgrade the % and the 3x rate.

- EXP unlocks this powerup: every time a resource is added, 10% chance of doubling the
value. Use Resources to upgrade this percentage chance.

- Hovertip for Labels in ResourceFrame and IngredientFrame to show where the +/sec are coming
from along with bonuses.

- Colors for the +#/sec, e.g. green if it's regular, orange or yellow for special bonuses, 
or red if we implement some feature that will decrease the quantity per second.

- Add a time + season system. Efficiency of plantation, field, and processes can slow
down during winter (or even turn off), and be more efficient in the spring or summer.

- Create a Text thing where we can write logs for stuff that happens.
Would be cool for a more complicated game with events. E.g. wild events happens that decreases
the production of chocolate for a while or generators break down and need to be fixed
(decrease efficiency of generators for a while). Also log changes in the time + season.
