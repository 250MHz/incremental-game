Ideas:
- Create a Text thing where we can write logs for stuff that happens.
Would be cool for a more complicate game with events. E.g. maybe have
random events like generators breaking down, or natural disasters hampering
production.

- Maybe put all statements that use .after() in one function.
Or maybe use .after() to call one funnction, and that one function does
all the increasing. It looks weird if multiple labels are updating
but they all update at different times.

- We can have colors for the +#/sec, e.g. green if it's regular, orange or
yellow for special bonuses, or red if we implement some feature that will
decrease the quantity per second.

- Thinking of adding EXP. Finishing certain achievements (e.g. build 1
standard generator, build 10 standard generators, build 100 standard
generators, etc.) will give EXP which will be shown by a Progressbar which will be in a separate Frame. Reaching certain levels can unlock new bonuses or
powerups that the player can buy.
