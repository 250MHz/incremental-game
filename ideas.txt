Ideas:
- Add ice cream tab to Notebook. Use the ingredients to produce different types of ice cream.

- Add EXP. Finishing certain achievements (e.g. get 1 cow, get 10 cows, get 100 cows) will 
give EXP which will be shown by a Progressbar which will be in a separate Frame. 
Reaching certain levels can unlock new bonuses or powerups that the player can buy. Have the
powerups be in anoter tab in the Notebook.

- Powerup idea using EXP, increase the efficiency of converting ice cream (e.g. change
from spending 50 milk to 45 milk). Also apply this to make it cheaper to make different
types of ice cream in the ice cream tab.

- Add efficiency system. Use EXP to increase efficiency of buildings.

- Colors for the +#/sec, e.g. green if it's regular, orange or yellow for special bonuses, 
or red if we implement some feature that will decrease the quantity per second.

- Add a time + season system. Efficiency of plantation, field, and processes can slow
down during winter (or even turn off), and be more efficient in the spring or summer.

- Create a Text thing where we can write logs for stuff that happens.
Would be cool for a more complicated game with events. E.g. wild events happens that decreases
the production of chocolate for a while or generators break down and need to be fixed
(decrease efficiency of generators for a while). Also log changes in the time + season.
